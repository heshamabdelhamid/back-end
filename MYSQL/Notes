 ---------- CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION ----------

A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. 
A collation is a set of rules for comparing characters in a character set. 
Let's make the distinction clear with an example of an imaginary character set.

Suppose that we have an alphabet with four letters: A, B, a, b. 
We give each letter a number: A = 0, B = 1, a = 2, b = 3. The letter A is a symbol, 
the number 0 is the encoding for A, and the combination of all four letters and their encodings is a character set.


 ---------- CREATE DATABASE ---------- 

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-database.html
https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-create-database/

CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name
[CHARACTER SET charset_name]
[COLLATE collation_name]


1 - First, specify name of the database after the the CREATE DATABASE keywords.
    The database name must be unique within a MySQL server instance.
    If you attempt to create a database with a name that already exists, MySQL will issue an error.

2 - Second, use the IF NOT EXISTS option to conditionally create a database if it doesnâ€™t exist.

3 - Third, specify the character set and collation for the new database.
    If you skip the CHARACTER SET and COLLATE clauses, 
    MySQL will the default character set and collation for the new database.

 ---------- using the mysql client tool ---------- 

* mysql -u root -p

CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] sTORE_DB;

Finally, select the newly created database to work with by using the USE statement:

USE testdb;

 ---------- DROP DATABASE ---------- 

The DROP DATABASE statement drops all tables in the database and deletes the database permanently. 
Therefore, you need to be very careful when using this statement.
If you drop a database that does not exist, MySQL will issue an error.

To prevent an error from occurring if you delete a non-existing database, you can use the IF EXISTS option. 
In this case, MySQL will terminate the statement without issuing any error.

DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] database_name;

 ---------- CREATE TABLE ---------- 
https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-create-table/

 CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   table_constraints
);

column_name data_type(length) [NOT NULL] [DEFAULT value] [AUTO_INCREMENT] column_constraint;
